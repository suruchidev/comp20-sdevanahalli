What is this purpose of this Git repository? 

It is a folder containing all the assignments and labs that I have completed for the class Comp 20- Web Programming, at Tufts University. 

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment was 2048, because, while we were given instructions and some guidelines, I was able to do all of it on my own and it really built up my confidence. I am much more comfortable working with the server side and understand it better.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I feel like I have grown a lot because my skill set has definitly increased. I also feel that the course has taught me how to be a self learner and this will be important in future internships and jobs.

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

I learned that you don't have to reinvent the wheel. There are so many API's and other resources out there that can make our lives a lot easier. For example the google maps API that we used for assignment 2. 

I learned that the best way for me to learn is to actually do. For example, I was amazed at how similar JavaScript is to the languages I have used in the past. So it wasn't very hard to pick it up. By the end of assignment 2, I felt pretty confident with JavaScript. 

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I am very interested in databases and security. I would really like to learn both at a deeper level.
